# Python-API-challenge
This Challenge is broken down into 2 parts. The first one is called WeatherPy and the second is called VacationPy. 

# WeatherPy
Tasked to visualize the weather of over 500 cities of varying distances from the equator. The citipy Python library and the OpenWeatherMap API will be needed to create a representative model of weather across cities. The first requirement is to create plots to showcase the relationship between weather variables and latitude. The second requirement goal is to compute a linear regression model for each relationship.

# VacationPy
In this part of the challenge, Geoapify API and the geoViews python library are needed to create a map with visualizations. The goal is to create a map that displays a point for every city listed in the provided DataFrame based on humidity. Then narrow down the DataFrame to ideal weather conditons. Finally, use Geoapify API to find the first gotel located within 10,000 meters of the provided coordinates.
